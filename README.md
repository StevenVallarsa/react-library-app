# React Library App
## A sample react app to keep track of the material in a media library

Working with Mosh Hamedani's __React 18 + Typescript__ course, I'm going to reacquaint myself with __React__, and acquaint myself with __Typescript__.

I will be modifying the video game library this course is presenting with my own take on a media library, since I don't play video games, but I do have a load of books, booklets, records, cassette tapes, video tapes, CDs, DVDs, etcâ€¦ etc...
